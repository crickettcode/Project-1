## Hangman Game

The game that I chose for my first project is *Hangman*. I wanted my game to be simple, clean, and to function correctly. I feel that I was able to accomplish these objectives. 
The game begins with the user viewing the game board, a box containing the letters of the alphabet and an empty box that reads "Lost", as well as an area with eleven blank spaces. 
In order to begin the game, the user selects a letter from the alphabet box by clicking on the letter. The letter will then either appear in the "Lost" letter box or appear over the eleven blank spaces at the top. The letter also will disappear from the "Alphabet" box. If the user is able to correctly guess the four letters of the word, then a message will display "Winner", and the game will end. Else, after 6 failed attempts, the game displays the alert of "Game Over" and the game will end.

## Version2

* I would like the progress bar to work in version two 
* I would like an actual hangman to be displayed in the second version
* I would also like to use an array of words in the next draft that is writtten in dynamic code

## Favorite Obstacle

My favorite obstacle was probably the one that happened on the last day before my project was due. I had to re-write the code that I had previously used to display the letters in the array of the secret word. I had to scratch my for-loop and instead use the "hide/show" method with CSS and jQuery. I liked how Jackson broke down the if/else statement that was also used to solve the "problem" of displaying the secret word. I was proud of myself for sticking with the logic until I was able to arrive at a solution. It led to a better understanding of my code. 

## Takeaway 

Some of my takeaways from this first project were, learning how to break down large problems into bite-sized portions, sticking to the user story, and also practicing flexibility with solutions. I am proud of my work, and what I have learned through the difficulties of building a simple game logic, conditions, and framework.
