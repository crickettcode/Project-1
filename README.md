## Hangman Game

The game that I chose for my first project is *Hangman*. I wanted my game to be simple, clean, and to function correctly. I feel that I was able to accomplish these objectives. 
The game begins with the user viewing the game board, a box containing the letters of the alphabet and an empty box that reads "Lost", as well as an area with eleven blank spaces. 
In order to begin the game, the user selects a letter from the alphabet box by clicking on the letter. The letter will then either appear in the "Lost" letter box or appear over the eleven blank spaces at the top. The letter also will disappear from the "Alphabet" box. If the user is able to correctly guess the four letters of the word, then a message will display "Winner", and the game will end. Else, after 6 failed attempts, the game displays the alert of "Game Over" and the game will end.
